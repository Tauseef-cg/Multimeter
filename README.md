Exploring the Multimeter
A multimeter is a handy tool used to measure current, voltage, and resistance in both AC and DC circuits. It comes with two probes—one red and one black. The black probe is always connected to the middle socket labeled COM, while the red probe is switchable depending on what you're measuring.
For voltage or resistance, the red probe should be connected to the socket right next to the COM port. To measure current, move the red probe to the left socket, usually labeled for 10A. This helps prevent damage if the current is higher than expected.

Measuring Resistance
To measure resistance, place one probe on one side of the resistor and the other probe on the opposite side. It's important to test resistance when the resistor is not connected to an active circuit, or else the reading won't be accurate. The continuity function, usually found next to the ohm (Ω) symbol, is useful for checking if there's a complete path between two points. If there is, the multimeter will beep.

Measuring Voltage
Before measuring voltage, it’s important to understand the symbols:
•	A wavy line (∿) next to V stands for AC voltage (like wall outlets).
•	A straight line with dashes under it represents DC voltage (like batteries).
Voltage is always measured in parallel with the component. This is useful, for example, to check if a battery is fully charged or working properly.

Measuring Current
To measure current, first switch the red probe to the left socket marked 10A. Current must be measured in series, which means you place the multimeter in-line with the circuit—like it becomes part of the wire. This allows current to flow through the multimeter so it can measure it accurately.

If the Multimeter Isn’t Working
If your multimeter isn’t responding or seems dead, the fuse inside might be blown. Just open the casing by unscrewing it and replace the fuse or battery with the correct type. That’s all it takes to get it back up and running.
